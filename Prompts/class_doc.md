Create or update XML documentation comments for Albatross.Expression and Albatross.Expression.Utility projects.  Your task is to add or improve **XML documentation comments** for all symbols with public or protected accessibility.  Exclude class constructors with no parameters.

Requirements:
1. Generate **triple-slash `///` XML documentation**.
2. For classes/interfaces, describe their purpose and typical usage.
3. For methods, include `<summary>` explaining what it does, `<param>` tags for all parameters, and `<returns>` if applicable.
4. For properties, provide `<summary>` describing the meaning of the property.
5. Be concise but informative. Avoid boilerplate like "Gets or sets the property". Instead, explain its actual intent if known.
6. If the purpose cannot be inferred from the code, mark with `[TODO: Add documentation]`.
7. Preserve the original code formatting. Only insert or update the documentation comments.
